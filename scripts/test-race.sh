# Run the test suite under the race detector in a Linux container.
#
# Why this exists: the race detector requires cgo and a working C toolchain,
# and the Windows development machine's gcc is broken. Rather than fix a
# machine, run the detector where it works. Everything the suite needs -- Go
# and git -- is in the image; nothing is installed on the host.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/test-race.sh                 # whole suite, race detector on
#   scripts/test-race.sh ./internal/...  # a subset
#   scripts/test-race.sh -run TestFoo ./internal/pipeline
#
# Runs from Git Bash on Windows, and from a shell on Linux/macOS.
