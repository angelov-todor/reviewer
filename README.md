# reviewer

An automated review pass over the project's pull requests, ahead of human
review — and again whenever the code changes.

`reviewer` is a Go daemon that finds pull requests two ways: links posted in
the team's Google Chat space, and open pull requests on GitHub with a review
requested from it. For each one it runs a
[Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) review in an isolated
git worktree, posts the findings as a comment, and submits a verdict —
approve, request changes, or comment.

One review per pull request per commit, whichever source found it. A pull
request is reviewed again only when there are new commits (see
[Second pass](#second-pass)), and the review says which pass it is: an
approval on a later pass covers the new commits, not the whole change.

It is advisory. It never pushes, never merges, and is not meant to be the
approval that unblocks one.

> The name is a placeholder. In the code and the comments the daemon is "the
> service" and the `claude` subprocess it drives is "the reviewer", so the
> next rename touches identifiers only and leaves the prose alone.

## How it works

One sweep, on a ticker or on demand:

1. Read new messages from the configured Google Chat space.
2. Extract GitHub pull request links from the message text (full URLs and
   `owner/repo#n` shorthand).
3. Filter: skip PRs you authored, PRs whose owner isn't on `allow_owners`,
   drafts, and anything already reviewed **at the commit it is now at** — see
   [Second pass](#second-pass).
4. For each survivor, prepare a throwaway git worktree against a local bare
   mirror of the repository.
5. Run `claude -p "Review pull request <pr-url> ..."` in that worktree, asking
   the reviewer to finish by printing one machine-readable verdict line. The
   ask is made **twice**: in the `-p` value, and again in
   `--append-system-prompt`.

   The prompt is a general instruction rather than a slash command, and that
   is deliberate. A command's own procedure crowds out the reviewer's skills;
   a general instruction lets them be selected for the repository being
   reviewed. Measured: in a C# fixture, a general review prompt loads
   `dotnet-techne-code-review` on its own.

   It does not always, though, and the service no longer depends on it. The
   first live review under the general prompt loaded no skill at all — that
   service repository carries an 859-line `CLAUDE.md`, and the model reviewed
   directly from it rather than reaching for a generic checklist. The review
   was good and simply had no severity labels. So the prompt asks for the
   shape it needs: **one severity per finding — blocking, important or
   suggestion**. That is also what makes the verdict rule checkable, since
   the service never sees a finding.

   Live, the reviewer posts its findings as **one comment** on the PR, each
   finding naming its file and line — not one comment per line. A per-line
   comment needs a path, a line and a diff position that still resolves; a
   single comment carries each location in its text and cannot fail to
   anchor.

   The duplication is not belt-and-braces for its own sake. The system prompt
   alone did not work: fourteen consecutive production reviews finished,
   posted their comments, and printed no verdict line, so every one of them
   submitted nothing. `/code-review` carries its own output contract, and over
   a long agentic run the task's instructions win — the same reviewer ignored
   an appended "do not perform any review" and worked for over three minutes.
   Restating the ask in the user turn puts it where it is the last thing said.
6. In dry run (the default), the findings are written to a report file and the
   reviewer is **told outright** to post nothing. That instruction matters:
   under the old slash command, dry run was expressed by withholding a
   `--comment` flag that the command never actually read, so the only thing
   keeping a dry run quiet was that the reviewer happened not to post. Live,
   the reviewer is told to post its findings in one comment — and
   the service writes a report anyway in the two live cases it could not otherwise
   explain: a review that finished without a verdict line, and one that did
   not finish at all. A live report says plainly that its comments are
   posted.
7. Submit that verdict as a GitHub review, so a reviewed PR is never silent —
   a clean one used to produce nothing at all, indistinguishable from the tool
   never having run. Nothing needing change (no findings, or only minor nits)
   is an **approval**, posted under your own GitHub identity. Only a
   **blocking** or **important** finding withholds one: nits, style and
   nice-to-haves are posted alongside an approval rather than blocking it.
   Anything blocking or important becomes a **comment** review, deliberately not
   request-changes: a comment leaves `reviewDecision` at `REVIEW_REQUIRED`, so
   the PR stays in the team's human review queue, whereas an approval would
   take it out. A dry run submits nothing and its report says what the verdict
   would have been.

   The bodies are deliberately short — one sentence saying what it found, and
   nothing else. No pass number, no link back to this repository, and no
   "machine-written" disclaimer: every one of them is a comment on somebody
   else's pull request, and boilerplate above the point is how a reader learns
   to skip the whole thing. Note the trade that last one makes: submitted
   under your own GitHub identity, nothing in the body now distinguishes these
   from a review you wrote by hand. The exception is a later pass, which adds
   one sentence saying it covered only the newest commits.

   **An approval covers the whole pull request.** Before the review runs,
   the service enumerates every piece of feedback already on the PR — unresolved
   and resolved inline threads, review bodies, and plain comments, from your
   colleagues as well as from its own earlier passes — and hands the reviewer
   an index of it. `approve` is only correct when the current code is sound
   *and* every previously raised point that required a change has been
   addressed. Minor nits do not block it.

   Two things override an `approve` regardless of what the reviewer decided,
   because they are about what the service knows rather than about the code:

   - **A human has requested changes.** the service never submits an approval
     over an outstanding `CHANGES_REQUESTED`; under your identity that reads as
     you clearing a colleague's block.
   - **The list came back incomplete.** GitHub answered and said there is more
     than it returned. An approval asserts that everything raised has been
     addressed, and a partial list cannot support that, so the review still
     runs and still comments — but it cannot approve, and it does not claim its
     findings were posted either, because a truncated list undercounts the
     baseline that claim is measured against.

   Either case records `approval withheld` in `status` and posts a comment
   review saying the review found nothing to change and why it is not
   approving anyway.

   If the feedback **cannot be read at all**, the PR is **deferred** rather
   than reviewed: the fetch happens before the clone, so it costs nothing, and
   the PR is offered again on the next sweep. This was learned in production. A
   ninety-second GitHub outage produced two reviews without their feedback
   lists, both approvals withheld and both records terminal — leaving a
   colleague's PR permanently unapproved, carrying a comment about the service's
   own limitation, with nothing that would ever try again. Retrying just the
   gate after the review would not fix it: a reviewer that was never shown what
   was raised cannot support the claim that it has all been addressed.
8. Live, the chat message that carried the link gets a reaction, so the team
   can see the PR has been picked up and, later, how it came out.

## Second pass

The dedupe rule is **once per commit, on a re-post** — not once per pull
request. A PR posted to the space again is reviewed again, but only if it has
new commits since the pass that already reviewed it.

**A second pass posts a fresh comment.** It is a whole review,
not an increment: the reviewer is told a previous pass ran and asked to
concentrate on what has changed and not to restate that pass's findings, but
nothing enforces it. Expect new comments on the pull request, and a new
verdict submitted alongside them.

What the reviewer is told depends on what the earlier pass actually did:

- **It posted its findings** — the usual live case. The reviewer is told which
  commit it reviewed and asked not to restate its findings, because they are
  already on those lines.
- **It did not finish** (a `needs_attention` record, reached only by
  `reviewer replay`). The reviewer is told plainly that some of that pass's
  findings may be posted and some may not, that nothing knows how far it got,
  and to check the pull request before posting a comment — and to raise
  anything that is not already there.
- **It posted nothing** — a dry run records a review but withholds
  `--comment`, so its findings went to a report on disk. The reviewer is told
  **nothing at all**: there is no comment to duplicate and nothing to hold
  back, and claiming otherwise would suppress every finding for no reason.
- **The head has not moved** (again only via `replay`). "Concentrate on what
  has changed" would name changes that do not exist, so instead the reviewer
  is asked for a full review, with the one caveat that still applies: check
  before posting a comment that may already be there.

All three of these must hold, or the re-post is skipped:

1. The existing record's outcome is `reviewed`, and it records the commit it
   reviewed. **No other outcome qualifies.** `needs_attention` in particular
   still needs an explicit `reviewer replay`: it means a review died
   mid-post, so comments may be half posted, and an automatic retry risks
   putting a second copy of each of them on a colleague's pull request. A
   re-post is not consent to that. Every skipped outcome fails for the plainer
   reason that nothing was ever reviewed.
2. The re-post is a **different chat message** from the one that triggered the
   recorded review, **and it was posted later than that message was**. The
   name check alone answers the wrong question. The same message can still be
   sitting in the fifty-message fetch window on the next sweep, and both a
   `-backfill` and a watermark gap re-offer *older* posts by design — while
   the sweep picks the oldest message carrying a link and the record holds the
   newest one seen. So the names differ, and an ordinary push nobody
   re-posted would otherwise become a second review.

   Comparing the two **post** times settles all of it, and it settles it for a
   reason that holds whatever the machine's clock says: both timestamps come
   from the Chat API, so any skew between Google's clock and this laptop's
   cancels instead of deciding the answer. Comparing a post time against the
   *review's* time would not — a clock an hour behind is enough to make a post
   that genuinely predates a review look later than it. A row written before
   the post time was recorded has nothing to compare and falls back to the
   review time, exactly as it behaved before.

   A re-post that arrives while its review is still running is refused and not
   kept: the review's own decision time is checked too, and a post from before
   it is dropped rather than deferred. That loses a nudge, silently; the next
   re-post triggers normally. It is the deliberate direction — a missed pass
   costs someone a second nudge, a spurious pass costs a colleague a duplicate
   comment set.

   A PR re-offered from the backlog carries the post that parked it, so a
   deferred second pass can still retry; one with no post recorded is not a
   re-post at all.
3. The **live head SHA is not a commit any pass has already reviewed** — not
   merely different from the last one. This is the invariant: no pull request
   is ever reviewed twice for the same commit, because that pass's comments
   are already on those exact lines. A head force-pushed back to an earlier
   reviewed commit is refused for the same reason as one that never moved.

Re-posted at an already-reviewed commit, the record's trigger message is
updated to the new post and nothing else about it changes, so the same re-post
is not re-inspected on every sweep for as long as it sits in the window.

The cost is one `gh pr view` per qualifying re-post — every re-post that gets
past conditions 1 and 2, not only the ones that turn out to have nothing new.
A re-post of a PR that has since been merged, been put back into draft or
changed hands pays that call too, and those skip *without* advancing the
recorded trigger, so each later re-post or re-scan of the same post pays it
again. All of them are reads; no new write of any kind is made.

`reviewer status` marks a later pass — `reviewed / findings (pass 2)`. A row
written before this feature existed has no pass number and reads as the first
pass it was. A dry run's report for a later pass is written to
`<owner>_<repo>_<n>_after_<short-sha>.md`, so it does not overwrite the report
the previous pass left behind: reading both is how you see what the new
commits changed.

Re-posted with no new commits, a merged, closed, drafted or reassigned pull
request keeps the record of the pass that reviewed it. Skipping is still right
— a merged PR must not be reviewed — but the reviewed commit, the submitted
verdict and the pass count are the only evidence of what the service did here,
and none of it is recoverable from anywhere else, so a skip does not overwrite
them. `reviewer status` therefore still shows such a PR as `reviewed`, not
`skipped_state`. Only the backlog entry is cleared.

`reviewer replay` still ignores the record when deciding whether to review —
that is the whole point of it, and none of the three conditions applies — but
it now **reads** the record first, so the reviewer is told that a pass has
already been here. That matters most for the case replay is documented for: a
`needs_attention` PR is one whose review died part-way through posting, and a
reviewer told nothing about that will restate every finding on the lines that
may already carry them. For such a record the reviewer is told plainly that
the earlier pass did not finish, that nothing knows how far it got, and to
check the pull request before posting a comment. A replay of a PR the service
has never reviewed is a first pass and says nothing. Unlike a re-post, a
replay that ends in a skip does record its own fresh decision: the operator
asked what the service makes of the PR now, and that is the answer.

### Running out of Claude capacity

One claude failure is not `needs_attention`: the account having no capacity
left. It posted nothing, it will succeed unchanged once the limit resets, and
it says nothing about the pull request, so recording the outcome that means
"a human has to look at this" strands work that would have reviewed itself.
Before this existed, an account that ran out mid-sweep left up to three pull
requests per sweep needing a hand-typed `reviewer replay`; the only defence
was to notice and run `reviewer pause`, which worked and should not have been
necessary.

Such a review is **deferred without counting an attempt**, deliberately unlike
the feedback-fetch deferral next to it. Attempts exist to retire a pull request
that fails on its own account; a usage limit is account-wide and time-based, so
counting them would retire the entire backlog inside about ninety minutes of
being rate-limited — the pull requests would be discarded for the one reason
that has nothing to do with them.

The rest of the sweep stops too. The limit applies to every candidate equally,
and each one would otherwise spend an Inspect, a clone and a claude start to
discover the same thing, so the first one to hit it latches for the sweep and
the remainder are parked untouched. Exactly what a mid-sweep pause does.

Two things keep this from being simply "defer on a usage limit". It is
recognised only from a **failed** run, so a successful review whose diff quotes
the phrase — an error string in somebody's code, a test fixture — is not
mistaken for one. And it is deferred only once the service has established that
**nothing was posted**: a limit reached after the reviewer began commenting
cannot be retried, because re-reviewing would put a second copy of those
comments on a colleague's pull request, which is the damage `needs_attention`
exists to warn about. A dry run posts nothing by construction and needs no
check. Anything unverifiable stays `needs_attention`.

The phrases are taken from the shipped claude binary rather than invented, and
the list is grounded but not authoritative — `USAGE_LIMIT_ERROR_PREFIXES` is
minified beyond reading in the bundle. The design accounts for that: an
unmatched failure keeps the old behaviour exactly, so a missed phrase costs a
`needs_attention` record — today's outcome — and never anything worse. "Rate
limit" on its own is deliberately not matched; the CLI uses that phrase about
GitHub throttling and bash tool concurrency, and deferring on either would park
a pull request that no amount of waiting fixes.

## Chat reactions

Live only, a message that carried a PR link is reacted to:

- 👀 as soon as the first pull request from that message starts being
  reviewed.
- ✅ or 💬 once **every** pull request that message carried has reached a
  terminal outcome, at which point the 👀 is removed.

✅ means every pull request that message carried **and that the service actually
reviewed** came back with an **approve** verdict — the same verdict that
submits an approving GitHub review. 💬 means at least one of them wants a
human's eye: findings were raised, or the reviewer printed no verdict the service
recognised, or the verdict could not be submitted, or the review did not
finish. the service never reads ✅ into silence, so anything it does not know
counts as 💬.

Pull requests the service **skipped** are excluded from that decision. A skip is
not a finding — nothing was wrong with the code, the service simply had no
business reviewing it — so a message carrying one clean review and one merged
or out-of-org link still gets ✅.

The reaction belongs to the **chat message, not the pull request**. One post
routinely carries several links and reviews run strictly one at a time, so a
per-PR reaction would say nothing a reader could act on: the useful statement
is "this post has been picked up" and then "this post is done with".

Three consequences worth knowing:

- **A sibling PR that is not ready holds the result reaction back.** The
  result belongs to the message, so it waits until *every* link on that
  message is finished. A draft posted alongside a reviewable PR is deferred,
  not decided, and keeps being retried until it is marked ready or its backlog
  entry expires — up to `pending_max_age`, a week by default. Until then the
  message keeps 👀 even though the PRs the service could review are all done.
  That is deliberate: one result reaction per message is the whole point, and
  reacting before the message is finished would mean reacting twice. But it is
  the state you are most likely to see and misread, so `reviewer status` is
  the place to look — the draft will be sitting in the deferred list.
- A message whose every link was skipped — owner not on `allow_owners`, a
  denied repo, merged, closed, a draft, your own PR — gets **no reaction at
  all**. Nothing was reviewed, so there is nothing to report, and a bare ✅
  would be the first the team heard of it.
- `reviewer replay` reacts to nothing on the way in: its trigger is the
  literal `replay` and identifies no chat message. A PR re-offered from the
  backlog **does** now react, because a parked PR keeps a record of the post
  that offered it — so a draft that becomes ready a day later, or a review the
  per-sweep cap pushed to the next sweep, finally puts 👀 on the post that
  asked for it instead of leaving that post silent about a review that
  happened. A backlog row written before this was recorded carries no post and
  reacts to nothing, as before. Either way the message is still finished off:
  the sweep that decides its last pull request adds the result reaction,
  whichever path decided it.

Reactions are cosmetic, and the service treats them that way. A failed reaction
— a missing OAuth scope, a deleted message, a network blip — is logged and
nothing more: it never changes a review's outcome, never defers a PR, never
affects the verdict submitted on it, and never stops the next review.
`dry_run` reacts to nothing, `-print-only` reacts to nothing, and a `PAUSE`
file stops reactions along with everything else outward-facing.

The chat script needs two more subcommands for this, `add-reaction
<message-name> <emoji>` and `remove-reaction <reaction-name>`; see
`internal/chat` for the expected output shape. Without them, reactions fail
and are logged, and reviews carry on exactly as before.

Decisions and outcomes are recorded in a local `bbolt` database, so restarts
and crashes never cause a PR to be reviewed twice for the same commit. Which
PRs each chat message carried is recorded there too, because the result
reaction can be hours behind the post that triggered it.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 to build.
- [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/), authenticated (`gh auth login`).
- [`claude`](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) on `PATH`.
- `git` on `PATH`.
- A script that can read your Google Chat space and print its messages as
  JSON on stdout, and add and remove reactions on a message.
  **the service does not talk to the Google Chat API directly** — it drives
  this script as a subprocess, the same way it drives `git` and `gh`. No such
  script is included in this repository; you need to supply or write one
  yourself (see `internal/chat` for the expected subcommands and output
  shapes). Reactions need an OAuth scope covering
  `spaces.messages.reactions`; `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.messages`
  covers it.

## Install and configure

```
go build ./cmd/reviewer
```

Copy `config.yaml.example` to `%APPDATA%\the service\config.yaml` and fill in
the fields it marks as required: `space`, `github_login`, `allow_owners`, and
`paths.chat_script`. `reviewer doctor` refuses to say a fresh, unconfigured
install is healthy — it will tell you which of these is still missing.

Run `reviewer doctor` to check every external dependency (`git`, `claude`,
`gh` auth, whether the `gh` token actually carries the `repo` scope
`gh pr review` needs to submit a verdict, the chat script, and that the
configured Google Chat account can actually see named spaces).

## Commands

- `scan` — one sweep, then exit. Flags: `-print-only`, `-backfill N`,
  `-live`, `-quiet`. Also the intended Task Scheduler entry point.
- `watch` — sweep on a ticker until interrupted. Flag: `-live`.
- `status` — print the review table: what's been reviewed, skipped, or
  deferred.
- `replay <pr-url | owner/repo#n>` — force one PR through review again,
  ignoring the dedupe record but telling the reviewer that an earlier pass has
  already been here. Flags: `-live`, `-quiet`.
- `clear <pr-url | owner/repo#n>` — mark a `needs_attention` or `in_flight`
  record handled, once a human has dealt with it. Flag: `-note text`.
- `catchup` — skip to now: move the chat watermark to the newest message
  without reviewing the gap. Prints the pull requests it is skipping first.
  Flag: `-print-only`.
- `doctor` — preflight every external dependency, and run each configured
  source's real query, reporting what came back. A full page is reported as a
  failure: it means pull requests exist that the service will never see.
- `pause` / `resume` — write / remove a kill-switch file. While paused,
  sweeps still queue new PRs but run no reviews and post nothing.

Every command accepts `-config <path>` to point at a config file other than
the default.

### Clearing a record a human has dealt with

`needs_attention` is terminal, and rightly: a review that died part-way through
may have posted half its comments, so a person has to look. But once that
person has looked, there was no way to say so. The row asked for attention in
`reviewer status` forever, and the only thing that moved it was `the service
replay` — which reviews the pull request again, possibly long after it merged.

`reviewer clear <pr>` marks it, and marks rather than deletes. Deleting the
row would take the dedupe record with it, so the same link posted again in chat
— a colleague bumping an old thread — would review from scratch something
already dealt with. A `cleared` outcome is terminal like the rest, and
deliberately distinct from `reviewed`: the service did not review that pull
request, and recording that it had would be a false record.

The original detail is kept inside the new one, because it is the only account
of what went wrong and exists nowhere else once the log rotates. Only the two
outcomes that ask for attention are clearable — clearing a settled row could
only lose information, and clearing a `reviewed` one would overwrite the record
of a verdict the service actually submitted on somebody's pull request. Any
backlog entry goes too, since a pull request declared handled must not be
re-offered by the next sweep.

The store takes an exclusive lock, so like `status`, this runs while the daemon
is stopped.

## Sources

A **source** is a place the service looks for pull requests. Both kinds are
written in the config, so the file names every source rather than naming one
and implying the other.

```yaml
sources:
  - type: chat
    space: "spaces/AAQA7zIDu54"
  - type: github
    owner: AstraBit-CPT
    repo_prefixes: [aex-]
    exclude_authors: [app/dependabot]
    exclude_bots: true
```

What the config cannot do is switch the chat space off. A config with no chat
space at all is **refused**, not quietly run without one — deleting that entry
is a mistake nobody would notice in a log, so it is an error instead. The space
may be declared on the chat source or left in the top-level `space` key, and an
installation that predates sources has only the latter and keeps working
untouched. Two chat sources are refused as well: everything downstream reads a
single space, so a config naming two would silently watch whichever was written
last.

The chat source is declared but not searched — `Sweep` has already fetched its
messages, with the watermark, the reactions and the sibling grouping that go
with them.

The chat space carries the two things a search cannot: which pull requests were
posted together, and a message to react to. A GitHub source is an addition to
it, so a GitHub outage or a rate limit costs the service the discovered pull
requests for one sweep and never the posted ones.

**A source finds pull requests with a review requested from you, and there is
deliberately no mode that finds everything.** Measured against a real
organisation, "every open pull request" is over five hundred — each a clone, a
claude run, and a comment on a colleague's pull request nobody asked for. A
review request is the same property that makes the chat space work: somebody
asked.

`exclude_authors` goes into the search query itself, which is what keeps the
result to a single request. Bots dominate a review-requested queue — 314 of 327
on the organisation this was built against — so without the exclusion the real
pull requests are crowded off the page. `exclude_bots` is the second net, for
the bot nobody has added to that list yet, and the service warns when a page
comes back full.

### Starting without reviewing history

A source's first sweep reviews **nothing**. The pull requests already open at
that moment are its history — eight when this was switched on here, half of
them months old — and without the guard, starting the daemon would post a
review on every one of them inside a quarter of an hour. The moment is recorded
and only what is touched afterwards is offered: a push, a comment, a new review
request. `review_backlog: true` on the source switches this off, for somebody
who genuinely wants an existing backlog reviewed once.

This is the rule the chat side has always had — a first run against a populated
space reviews nothing — applied to sources. A source is identified by its owner
and login rather than its position in the list, so reordering the entries or
adding one above an existing source does not read as a new source and
cold-start one that has been running for weeks.

The chat equivalent for an existing installation is `reviewer catchup`, which
moves the watermark to the newest message without reviewing what came before
it. Use it when the service has been off for a while and that window has already
been dealt with by hand. It prints the pull requests it is about to skip, with
how many were already decided, before it moves anything — they will not be
reviewed unless somebody posts them again or you `replay` them — and
`-print-only` shows the same list while leaving the watermark alone.

### One review per commit, whichever source found it

A pull request posted in chat and returned by a search is reviewed **once**.
The chat message wins the tie, because it is the one that carries the sibling
group and something to react to.

A pull request already reviewed at its current head is **not** reviewed again
until there is a follow-up commit. That rule predates sources and is enforced
in one place — the head SHA gate below `Inspect`, which does not know or care
which source offered the candidate.

What each source has is a cheap *prompt*: a reason to spend one `gh pr view`
asking whether the head has moved. For chat that is a newer post; for a source
it is GitHub's `updated_at` being later than the last decision. Neither is
permission to review. GitHub moves `updated_at` for a comment as readily as for
a push, so a discussed pull request is offered again and turned away by the SHA
gate — the prompt is deliberately generous and the gate is exact. Without the
prompt, discovery would spend one GitHub call per pull request per sweep for no
new information, and the service shares that rate limit with the reviews.

GitHub sometimes answers with `incomplete_results` — its search giving up part
way. Against this organisation, three identical calls returned 6, 8 and 9 of a
reported 9, with the flag set every time, so it is not transient and no
configuration change clears it. It is reported and not treated as a failure:
discovery re-runs every sweep, so a pull request one partial search missed is
offered by the next. A **full page** is the different case and is actionable —
exclude the noisiest authors.

`reviewer doctor` runs each source's query for real and prints what came
back — scanned, matched, and how many survived the bot filter. A source that
returns nothing otherwise looks exactly like a quiet week: a typo in the login,
an owner with no review requests and a `repo_prefixes` matching no repository
all produce the same silence as a working source on a calm day.

Discovery is one request per source per sweep, through `gh api search/issues`
rather than `gh search prs`: the author exclusions have no flags on that
command, which quotes a positional query as free-text keywords and silently
returns the wrong thing. Results are truncated rather than paged, because
paging that endpoint trips GitHub's secondary rate limit within a few requests
— and a discovery step that can starve the reviews is a bad trade.

## Compliance

`docs_root` is optional. Set it to a checkout of the project's specifications
and compliance material, and the reviewer is told where that material is and
asked to check any change touching behaviour a specification or regulation may
govern — endpoints, fields, thresholds, denial rules, status transitions,
events, or anything in margin, futures, liquidation, fee, interest, KYC,
withdrawal, surveillance or position-limit behaviour.

It is a path rather than anything copied into the prompt. The compliance books
alone run to roughly 700,000 words — about five context windows — so the
reviewer searches them. The note distinguishes the small top-level documents
worth opening (gap analysis, audit requirements, open questions, the service
registry) from the books, which are for grepping, and points at the team's own
written retrieval procedure.

Two rules travel with it, and the second matters more than the first: a
compliance finding must **cite** the document and section it rests on, and a
finding that cannot be cited must not be raised at all. the service submits under
your GitHub identity, and an invented regulatory claim on a colleague's pull
request costs more than the finding could have been worth.

`doctor` checks the path exists when it is set — a wrong path yields reviews
indistinguishable from reviews with nothing to say about compliance, which is
the failure mode hardest to notice.

## Related pull requests

When several PR links arrive in one chat message, the team is saying those
changes belong together — an API change and its frontend, a service change and
its deployment. Reviewed apart, neither review can see whether the two halves
agree.

Each PR still gets its own review, its own verdict and its own comment. What
changes is that every review is handed the **diffs of the others from the same
message**, as context. Reviewing the API change, the reviewer can see that the
frontend PR posted alongside it never renamed the field; reviewing the
frontend, that the API renamed it. The finding lands on whichever PR it
concerns.

Details worth knowing:

- **Diffs, not checkouts.** Worktree paths are per pull request, so two
  concurrent reviews of the same post would want the same directory for the
  sibling they share; collision-free copies would mean up to nine checkouts of
  large service repos on disk for one three-way post. A diff is also the
  artifact the cross-check needs — often for what it does *not* contain.
- **At most two siblings, each capped at 6 KB** — and that number comes from
  Windows, not taste. A process's whole command line is capped at 32,767
  characters, and the diffs travel inside a single `--append-system-prompt`
  argument. Measured on this machine: a 33,000-character argument fails with
  `fork/exec: The filename or extension is too long`, and a failed exec is a
  review recorded `needs_attention` and never retried — so an oversized prompt
  would leave a PR that reviewed fine yesterday permanently unreviewed.
  `review.Run` checks the total independently and drops the sibling block
  (never truncates it) if it will not fit, saying so in the log.
- A cut diff says it was cut, so the reviewer does not read a missing change as
  evidence there was none.
- **A sibling outside `allow_owners` is never fetched.** The chat space is a
  chat room, not an access boundary: a link to an unrelated repository turns up
  eventually, and the same rule that stops the service reviewing it stops
  the service reading it.
- **A sibling that cannot be fetched costs context, not the review.** This is
  deliberately the opposite of the feedback fetch, which withholds an
  approval: an approval makes a claim about the feedback, while a review makes
  no claim about its siblings.
- **The reviewer is told not to review them** — and told whether the service is
  reviewing each one separately. A sibling under review will get its own
  comments; one that is not (a draft, your own, already reviewed) gets no
  other look, which changes whether a problem spotted there is worth
  mentioning.
- A PR re-offered from the pending backlog has no siblings: there is no
  message to group it by.

## Concurrency

By default reviews are serial: one pull request is reviewed to completion
before the next starts. Three posted at once, at roughly 12 minutes each, is
therefore about 36 minutes before the last one is done.

`review_concurrency` raises that. The default is `1`, so an upgrade never
makes the service do more at once than the operator asked for. Setting it above
`max_reviews_per_sweep` is allowed and just has no effect beyond the cap.

```yaml
max_reviews_per_sweep: 3
review_concurrency: 3
```

Sweeps themselves stay serial — one sweep finishes before the next begins.
That is what keeps `recover in-flight` sound: an `in_flight` record found at
the start of a sweep can only have come from a run that is no longer alive.

Two things worth knowing before raising it:

- **The limit you hit first is probably not this machine.** Each review is a
  `claude -p` session doing tool calls, and they share one account's rate
  limits. Past a small number, extra workers tend to queue rather than add
  throughput. Try 3 before trying more.
- **Ctrl-C costs more.** A hard kill mid-review leaves an `in_flight` record
  that becomes `needs_attention` and is never retried automatically. With
  three reviews in flight that is three of them. Stop the daemon between
  sweeps where you can.

Worktrees are per pull request, but the bare mirror behind them is per
repository, so `Prepare` takes a per-repository lock: two pull requests from
the same service queue for the clone and fetch, then review in parallel.

That lock covers checkout setup, not the reviews themselves. Worktrees share
the mirror's refs, so while one review is running, a sibling's fetch does move
`refs/remotes/origin/*` under it. Measured: a two-dot `git diff origin/main`
inside a live worktree grew a file the pull request never touched. A three-dot
`origin/main...HEAD` — which is what the reviewer actually uses — is immune,
because the merge base stays at the branch point. Making this airtight would
mean either a clone per pull request or serialising same-repository reviews,
which is the case worth parallelising most, so it is documented rather than
locked.

## Tests

```
go test ./...            # the suite
scripts/test-race.sh     # the suite under the race detector, in Docker
```

The race detector needs cgo and a working C toolchain. Rather than require one
on every machine, `scripts/test-race.sh` runs the suite in the container
defined by `Dockerfile.test`; nothing is installed on the host. It takes the
same arguments as `go test`:

```
scripts/test-race.sh ./internal/pipeline
scripts/test-race.sh -run TestSweep ./internal/pipeline
```

Run it before changing anything concurrent. It has already caught one defect
the Windows suite could not see: a cancelled command was killed but `Run` did
not return until it finished anyway, so `review_timeout` and Ctrl-C both failed
to stop a review.

## Safety

Read this before running anything other than `doctor` or `scan -print-only`.

- **`dry_run: true` is the default.** Passing `-live`, or setting
  `dry_run: false` in the config, is what makes the service post real comments
  to real pull requests, under your GitHub identity — and what makes it react
  to real chat messages, under your Google identity. `dry_run` is an absolute
  "no outward effect" switch: a dry run does not react, does not submit
  a verdict, and does not even record the state a reaction would need.
- **A re-post reviews the PR again, and posts a second set of inline
  comments.** Only when it has new commits since the last pass — see
  [Second pass](#second-pass) — but when it does, the author gets a fresh
  review on their pull request and a fresh verdict submitted under your
  identity. The reviewer is asked not to restate the previous pass's findings;
  that is a request in a system prompt, not a guarantee.
- **A clean PR is approved under your own GitHub identity.** Live, a
  successful review always ends in a submitted GitHub review: an approval when
  the reviewer raised nothing or only nits, a comment review when it raised
  anything Critical or Important. Your colleagues see both as *you*, which is
  why every body opens by saying it is machine-written and links this
  repository. A findings verdict is never request-changes, so a machine never
  blocks a merge on its own — but an approval does clear `reviewDecision`, and
  that is a real approval on someone else's work. Nothing is submitted unless
  the review itself succeeded and the reviewer printed a verdict line
  the service recognises: a missing or unrecognised line submits nothing and is
  recorded as `reviewed / verdict unknown`, never guessed into an approval. A
  submission that fails leaves the review recorded as `reviewed` with the
  error visible in `reviewer status`, and is not retried.
- **`allow_owners` is the blast-radius control, and it has no default.** A
  Google Chat space is a chat room, not an access boundary — someone will
  eventually paste a link to a repository you don't intend the service to
  touch. Set `allow_owners` before running anything live.
- **`--permission-mode bypassPermissions` in `claude_args` is not
  sandboxed by the worktree.** The review subprocess inherits your full
  environment and can reach anything you can reach — including
  repositories outside `allow_owners` — because that allowlist decides
  which PRs the service chooses to review, not what the subprocess is capable
  of once it's running. The checkout it reviews is also attacker-influenced:
  it's the pull request author's code, and it may carry its own `CLAUDE.md`
  or `.claude/` configuration that a headless agent with no human at the
  prompt will read as instructions. See
  `docs/superpowers/reviews/2026-09-03-final-review-outcomes.md` for the
  full analysis and the mitigations that were considered but not applied.
- **Inline comments are exercised; the verdict is not.** Parsing and
  filtering were checked against 200 messages of real chat history, and a
  dry-run `replay` produced a substantive report in 12m15s, which is why
  `review_timeout` defaults to 30m. Comments have since been posted live: on
  a 7-file, +539/−12 pull request the service left three inline comments (under
  the earlier per-line posting, since replaced by one comment per review),
  including one that falsified a security claim in the PR's own description,
  one `IsSuccessStatusCode` trap where a 2xx with an undeserialisable body
  silently skips an audit-trail write, and one null dereference whose broad
  `catch` then logged the opposite of what had happened. That is the standard
  to hold it to, and it is the reason to read your own dry-run report (`scan
  -backfill N`, or `replay <url>`, without `-live`) before setting `dry_run:
  false`.

  What has **not** been exercised is the verdict. No review verdict has ever
  been submitted by this tool: the code path is new, and no real `claude` run
  has yet been observed printing the `FIRSTPASS-VERDICT:` line the reviewer is
  asked for. Until you have seen a dry-run report say "the verdict would have
  been" with a value you agree with — several times — treat the verdict as
  unproven, and remember that the approve case posts a real approval under
  your identity.
