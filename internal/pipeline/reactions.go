// messageLock returns the mutex guarding one chat message's reaction
// bookkeeping, creating it on first use.
//
// Both reaction stages read a message record, decide from it, and write it
// back, and both are reached from handle -- so two pull requests posted in one
// message, which is the ordinary case, run them concurrently. Unsynchronised,
// each stage is a lost update: both candidates read WatchApplied false, both
// set it, both write, and the message gets two 👀. The store's latch is what
// makes an outward act happen at most once, and a latch behind a
// read-modify-write is only a latch if the sequence is atomic.
//
// The lock is held across the chat calls as well as the store writes. That is
// the simpler of the two designs and the one less likely to be subtly wrong:
// releasing it around the call would mean writing back a record another
// goroutine may have changed in between. What that costs is a wait, and the
// wait is why this is keyed by message rather than shared by the whole
// pipeline. settleMessageReaction makes two chat calls, so a pipeline-wide
// lock could hold an unrelated candidate for up to twice chat_timeout --
// and it would hold it in the worst possible place, between that candidate's
// in_flight record being written and its review starting, where an interrupt
// leaves a needs_attention for a review that never began. Keyed by message,
// the only candidates that can wait are ones posted in the same message,
// whose reactions genuinely are the same piece of shared state.
