// TestReserveReviewNeverExceedsTheCap is the property the serial code got for

// before the review". Read as a pair of statements that is equivalent to a
// reservation; run concurrently it is not, because every worker can observe
// the same pre-cap count and each go on to review. The cap bounds how many of
// other people's pull requests the service writes comments on in one sweep, so
// exceeding it is not an accounting slip.
