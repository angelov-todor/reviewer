// Inspect.
//
// Condition 1: the record's outcome is `reviewed`, and nothing else -- and it
// records the commit it reviewed.
//
// needs_attention in particular does not qualify. It means a review died
// mid-post, so comments may be half posted on a colleague's pull request, and
// an automatic retry risks a second copy of each of them. A re-post is not
// consent to that; `reviewer replay` is. Every skipped outcome fails this
// too, for the plainer reason that nothing was ever reviewed: there is no
// first pass for a second one to follow.
//
// A reviewed record with no head SHA on it fails as well, and that is the
// safe direction rather than an oversight. Condition 3 is the guarantee that
// no pull request is reviewed twice for the same commit; a record that does
// not say which commit it reviewed cannot support that guarantee, so treating
// "unknown" as "different" would be double-posting on a colleague's pull
// request on the strength of a missing field. A pull request reviewed off the
// pending backlog carries no trigger message either, so the pairing is the
// usual one: no first-pass evidence, no automatic second pass. `the service
// replay` still works, and says the operator meant it.
//
// Condition 2: the trigger is a different, non-empty chat message, posted
// after the review finished.
//
// The name inequality is the cheap first filter and it kills the
// same-message-in-window case outright. It is not sufficient on its own,
// because it answers the wrong question: what has to be established is "this
// post came after we reviewed it", and two names differing does not say that.
//
// A watermark gap and a `scan -backfill N` both re-offer posts that are older
// than the review -- chat.Client returns the whole window when the watermark
// has fallen out of it and Sweep deliberately processes all of it, and a
// backfill ignores the watermark by design -- while candidates() takes the
// *oldest* message carrying a ref and the record holds the newest one seen. So
// the names differ, and if the head has moved for any reason at all, an
// ordinary push nobody re-posted becomes a full second comment set and a
// submitted verdict on a colleague's pull request. Invisibly, too: the older
// message's reaction latches are already set, so no 👀 and no result reaction
// appear to give it away. "A laptop closed over a weekend" is enough to
// produce the gap, and this is a daemon on a laptop.
//
// The time comparison subsumes all three cases at once. A gap re-scan and a
// backfill offer posts older than the review, so both are suppressed; a
// genuine re-post is newer, so it passes.
//
// DecidedAt rather than StartedAt, and strictly after rather than at: a post
// landing while the review was still running, or at the very moment it
// finished, cannot have been prompted by its result. Declining it is the
// fail-safe direction and costs nothing, because the next re-post is newer and
// does trigger. A record with no DecidedAt at all is refused for the same
// reason its missing head SHA is: nothing can establish the ordering, and
// unknown must not read as satisfied.
//
// The same message can still be sitting in the fifty-message fetch window on
// the next sweep -- a backfill, or a watermark gap, will offer it again -- and
// re-reviewing on that would review a pull request once per sweep forever. A

// terminalSkip records a terminal skip -- unless this candidate carries the
// record of a pass that has already reviewed this pull request, in which case
// that record is left exactly as it is and only the pending entry is cleared.
//
// Skipping is still right at every gate that calls this: a merged pull
// request, or one now attributed to you, must not be reviewed. What is not
// right is overwriting the record while doing it. That record is the only
// evidence of what the service did here -- the commit it reviewed, the verdict
// it submitted under the operator's own GitHub identity, and which pass that
// was -- and none of it is recoverable from anywhere else. A skip would
// replace all of it with a description of GitHub's current state.
//
// Not rewriting, rather than rewriting while preserving those fields, because
// the question the record answers is "what did the service do about this pull
// request", and it already answers it correctly. Somebody merging the pull
// request afterwards, or `github_login` changing under it, is not the service
// decision at all, and a record that said `skipped_state` with a reviewed
// SHA and a submitted verdict hanging off it would be a state no other code
// path can produce and no reader would know how to interpret.
//
// This applies only below the record gate. The owner allowlist and the deny
// list sit *above* it and still record their refusal unconditionally: those
// are the service's own decisions, they are the safety rails rather than a
// report of somebody else's action, and a candidate re-posted from a
// disallowed owner never reaches the record read at all.
//
// A replay is unconditional too, and that asymmetry is deliberate. A replay
// carries a previous record for the reviewer's sake, but the operator named
// this pull request and asked what the service makes of it now, so the fresh
// decision is the answer to a question that was actually asked -- and a stale
// "reviewed" detail left standing over an explicit `reviewer replay` is what
// TestReviewOneTerminalSkipReplacesThePriorRecord exists to prevent. A re-post
// asks for a review, not for a fresh verdict on whether the service should be
// reviewing, so declining it is not news worth overwriting history with.
//
// The pending entry is still deleted. That is housekeeping rather than
// history: left behind, it is re-offered on every sweep until it expires.
