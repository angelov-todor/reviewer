// sweepState is the state that candidates share while a sweep is running.
//
// Every field here was a plain field on SweepReport, written directly by
// handle, which was correct while exactly one candidate was ever in flight.
// Once several are, each of them is either a data race or a lost update, and
// two of them are outward-facing: the review cap decides how much of somebody
// else's pull request gets commented on, and the mid-sweep pause is a kill
// switch.
//
// It lives behind a mutex rather than in atomics because reserveReview has to
// compare and increment as one step, which is exactly what atomics cannot do
// without a loop, and because the cost is irrelevant next to a review.
