// seconds, two pull requests were reviewed without their feedback lists, both
// had their approvals withheld, and both were recorded `reviewed` -- which is
// terminal. So a colleague's pull request was left permanently unapproved,
// carrying a comment about the service's own limitation, with nothing that would
// ever try again.
//
// Retrying just the gate after the review was the tempting fix and is wrong:
// an approval asserts that everything already raised has been addressed, and a
// reviewer that was never shown what was raised cannot support that claim
// however healthy the network is by the time the verdict is submitted.
