// Worktrees are per pull request but mirrors are per repository, so two pull
// requests from the same service share one bare repository on disk -- and a
// team that posts several pull requests from one service in a single message
// is the ordinary case, not a corner. Every step of Prepare mutates that
// shared repository: it may `RemoveAll` and re-clone it, it fetches into it,
// and it runs `worktree prune`, which removes worktree registrations another
// review is in the middle of creating. Concurrent Prepares for one repository
// would range from git's "cannot lock ref" failures to one review deleting the
// mirror another is reading.
//
// The lock is per mirror rather than global so reviews of different
// repositories still run in parallel, which is the point of the exercise. It
// is held for the whole of Prepare, including the clone: a first clone of a
// large repository is slow, but a second review of the same repository has
// nothing to do until that clone exists anyway.
//
// What the lock does NOT cover is a review already running out of the mirror.
// Worktrees share the mirror's refs, so a sibling's fetch moves
// refs/remotes/origin/* under a live checkout. Measured in a fixture: a
// two-dot `git diff origin/main` inside a running worktree gained a file the
// pull request never touched. The three-dot form the reviewer actually uses,
// origin/main...HEAD, is immune, because the merge base stays at the branch
// point. Closing the gap properly would mean a clone per pull request, or
// holding the lock for the whole review and thereby serialising exactly the
// same-repository case that is most worth parallelising. It is documented in
// README instead.
