// feedbackFixture is shaped from real GitHub responses and sanitised for
// content.
//
// The shape was taken from two live pull requests and the parser was run
// against both before this fixture was written: one carried two reviews and
// six general comments and no inline threads at all, the other three inline
// threads. Every characteristic below is one of theirs -- a CI bot comment, a
// review whose body is empty, a thread with a null line, an unresolved thread
// that is outdated, and a resolved thread.
//
// It is sanitised because this repository is public and the real payloads are
// colleagues' review discussion. Inventing the shape would have been the
// mistake that shipped the list-spaces defect; copying the content would have
// been a worse one.
