// MaxDiffBytes bounds one sibling diff.
//
// 6 KB, and the number is set by Windows rather than by taste. The whole
// command line of a process is capped at 32,767 characters, and the sibling
// diffs travel inside a single --append-system-prompt argument alongside the
// docs note, the prior-feedback index and the prompt itself. Measured on the
// target machine: a 33,000-character argument fails with "fork/exec: The
// filename or extension is too long". A failed exec is a review that did not
// happen, recorded as needs_attention and never retried automatically -- so an
// oversized diff would take a pull request that reviewed fine yesterday and
// leave it permanently unreviewed.
//
// 6 KB is about fifteen hundred tokens: enough for the file list and the
// changed lines, which is what a cross-repo check needs. Two of them leave
// ample room under the cap, and review.Run enforces the total independently
// rather than trusting this arithmetic.
//
// A cut diff is reported as cut rather than silently shortened, because a
// reviewer that believes it saw the whole thing reads the absence of a change
// as evidence there was none.

// PRDiff returns the unified diff of a pull request, and whether it was cut.
//
// Used for the pull requests posted alongside the one under review: the service
// gives the reviewer their diffs as context so it can tell whether a coupled
// change agrees with itself across repositories.
