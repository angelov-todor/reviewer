// asked the service to look at. Requiring a review request keeps the property
// that makes the chat source work: somebody asked.

// want yields a handful of results. Deriving truncation from the filtered

	// other. Nothing the operator configures fixes this: measured against a
	// real organisation, three identical calls returned 6, 8 and 9 of a
	// reported 9, with incomplete_results set every time.
