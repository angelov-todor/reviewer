// PRRef identifies a single GitHub pull request.

// Owner and Repo are canonically lowercase. Every constructor in this package
// folds them, because Key() is a bbolt key and bbolt keys are case-sensitive:
// without folding, "example-org/aex-balances#91" and
// "Example-Org/aex-balances#91" would be two records for one pull request,
// and the second would earn it a second set of inline comments. GitHub URLs
// are case-insensitive and the operator's own checkout path for this org is
// lowercase, so a lowercased paste is routine rather than exotic. The mirror
// directory derived from these fields is case-insensitive on Windows, so
// folding also keeps the on-disk cache and the database agreeing.

// folded.
//
// It exists because a ref assembled by hand skipped that folding and produced
// a second key for a pull request the service already had one for -- GitHub
// answers "AstraBit-CPT" where a chat link says "astrabit-cpt" -- which reads
// through as a pull request reviewed twice, once under each spelling, and as a
// stored record its own next sweep cannot find.
