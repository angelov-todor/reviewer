// that made the verdict line never appear.

// pull request this was designed against is a CI summary. Unmarked, a build
// report reads as review feedback that must be addressed before an approval.
//
// Resolved threads are listed as well, on the owner's instruction, so a thread
// closed without a fix is still caught. The note is explicit that listing them
// is for the verdict and not an invitation to re-open what a colleague closed.
