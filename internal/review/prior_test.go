// An instruction in --append-system-prompt is not reliably followed over a
// long agentic run: the verdict ask lived there alone and produced nothing for
// fourteen consecutive production reviews. So the demand -- "your verdict
// covers the whole pull request, and only approve if prior points are
// addressed" -- goes in the -p value, next to the ask it constrains. The index
// of prior feedback is evidence rather than a demand, and evidence in the
// system prompt is simply available; it also cannot go in the -p value, which
// is a slash command's arguments.
