// TestTheCommandLineStaysWithinTheOperatingSystemsLimit is the assertion that
// stops this feature from silently un-reviewing pull requests.
//
// Windows caps a process's entire command line at 32,767 characters, and the
// sibling diffs travel inside a single --append-system-prompt argument.
// Measured on the target machine: a 33,000-character argument fails with
// "fork/exec: The filename or extension is too long". A failed exec is
// recorded as needs_attention and never retried automatically -- so an
// oversized prompt does not degrade a review, it takes a pull request that
// reviewed fine yesterday and leaves it permanently unreviewed.
//
// The worst case is built here rather than assumed: the maximum number of
// siblings, each at the maximum diff size, on top of a docs note and a full
// prior-feedback index.
