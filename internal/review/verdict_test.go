// TestThePromptCarriesTheVerdictAsk is the regression guard for the bug that

//
// That test asserted the -p value must NOT mention the verdict, reasoning that
// anything after "/code-review" becomes the slash command's $ARGUMENTS and
// would therefore be "at best ignored and no verdict line ever comes back".
// The reasoning was confident and wrong in the decisive direction: leaving the
// ask out of the prompt is what meant no verdict line ever came back.
// Fourteen consecutive production reviews finished, posted their comments and
// submitted nothing, and the test read as protection the whole time.
//
// What was actually measured, once live stdout was captured:
//
//   - the ask in --append-system-prompt alone, with a trivial -p prompt: the
//     line is printed exactly as asked. The mechanism was never the problem.
//   - the same ask alongside "/code-review <url>": ignored, and so was a far
//     blunter "do not perform any review" -- the reviewer worked for over
//     three minutes. The task's own instructions dominate.
//   - the ask added to the -p value: the reviewer's last line was
//     "REVIEW-VERDICT: findings", parsed and recorded. One variable
//     changed between that run and the failing one.
//
// The $ARGUMENTS worry was real but harmless: the command definition
// referenced $ARGUMENTS nowhere, so its arguments reached the reviewer as
// trailing prompt text rather than being parsed for flags. The slash command
// is gone now in favour of a general instruction, which removes the concern
// entirely -- but the measurement it produced is why the ask is still stated
// in the -p value and not left to the system prompt alone.
