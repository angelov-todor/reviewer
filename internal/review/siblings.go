// Sibling is another pull request that was posted in the same chat message as
// the one under review.
//
// It carries that pull request's diff rather than a checkout of it. Three
// alternatives were considered and this is the one that survives contact with
// how the service already works:
//
//   - A checkout per sibling collides. Worktree paths are per pull request, so
//     two concurrent reviews of the same group would both want the same
//     directory for the sibling they share.
//   - Collision-free copies mean up to nine checkouts of large service
//     repositories on disk for one three-way post, most of them identical.
//   - The URL alone leaves the reviewer to go and fetch things, which is the
//     shape of instruction this project has repeatedly measured being ignored.
//
// A diff is also the artifact the cross-check actually needs. "The frontend
// pull request posted with this one does not update the renamed field" is
// answered by seeing what the frontend pull request changed -- and, just as
// often, by seeing what it did not.

	// nothing else will look at. The reviewer was told to stay quiet about
