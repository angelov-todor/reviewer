		// there is what let this go unnoticed through fourteen consecutive
		// production reviews -- every one recorded "verdict unknown", and not
		// one of them left anything to read. Diagnosing it in the end took a
		// throwaway pull request and a dry run to reproduce what had already
		// happened fourteen times.
		//
		// A failed write is ignored on purpose: this is diagnostics for an
		// outcome that has already been recorded, and it must not turn a
		// review that succeeded into one that reports an error. It also must
		// not raise ReportError in live mode, whose recorded detail says
		// nothing was posted -- true of a dry run and a dangerous lie here.
		//
		// A review that did not finish qualifies for the same reason the
		// missing verdict does, and more urgently: it was posting comments one
		// at a time when it stopped, the service cannot tell how far it got, and
		// the operator is told comments may be half posted. Whatever the
		// reviewer had printed is the only evidence of how far it actually
		// got.
		//
		// Every live outcome keeps its output, and the condition is gone
		// entirely rather than listing which ones.
		//
		// Two changes brought it here. Posting became a prose instruction when
		// the slash command went away, and the skills a general prompt selects
		// do not necessarily post -- the .NET review skill produces a report
		// and posts nothing at all. And an `approve` stopped meaning "nothing
		// was found": under the current rule a pull request whose every finding
		// is a suggestion is an approval, with those suggestions posted
		// alongside it.
		//
		// Put together, there is no live outcome with provably nothing to
		// preserve. An approve that carried three suggestions the reviewer
		// reported instead of posting would, under the old condition, have
		// been recorded as "No findings needing a change" with the suggestions
		// discarded -- the tool looking like it found nothing when it had.
		// Keeping the output costs one small file per review.
