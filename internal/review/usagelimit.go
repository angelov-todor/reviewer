// UsageLimitError reports that the review did not run because the Claude
// account has no capacity left, rather than because anything is wrong with the
// pull request.
//
// The distinction is the whole point. Every other claude failure is recorded
// needs_attention: terminal, never retried automatically, and warning the
// operator that comments may be half posted. That is right for a killed review
// and wrong for this, which posted nothing, will succeed unchanged once the
// limit resets, and applies to every pull request equally rather than to this
// one.
//
// Without it, an account that ran out of tokens mid-sweep stranded up to three
// pull requests per sweep, each needing a hand-typed `reviewer replay`. The
// operator's own defence was to notice and run `reviewer pause`, which worked
// and should not have been necessary.

// usageLimitPhrases are the strings the claude CLI actually emits when an
// account is out of capacity.
//
// Taken from the shipped binary rather than invented: the 220 MB bundle
// contains "You've hit your limit", "You've hit your fast limit", "You've hit
// your monthly limit" and "You've hit your monthly spend limit", alongside a
// USAGE_LIMIT_ERROR_PREFIXES constant whose value is minified beyond reading.
// So this list is grounded but not authoritative, and the design accounts for
// that: an unmatched failure keeps the old behaviour exactly, so a phrase this
// list misses costs a needs_attention record -- today's outcome -- and never
// something worse.
//
// Deliberately not matching "rate limit" on its own. That phrase appears in
// the CLI about GitHub's rate limiting and about bash tool concurrency, and
// treating either as an account limit would defer a pull request that a plain
// retry will never fix.
