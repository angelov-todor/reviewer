// procedureSkill is the team's own written retrieval procedure, if the docs

//
// Named rather than left to be discovered. A skill inside the docs checkout
// sits outside the directory Claude Code searches for skills, so nothing loads
// it automatically -- and pointing at the file is deterministic where hoping a
// skill gets selected is not. That distinction is the same one that cost
// fourteen reviews their verdict.

// docsNote points the reviewer at the project's specification and compliance
// documentation. It travels in the system prompt, as context rather than as a
// demand.
//
// The material cannot travel any other way. In the checkout this was built
// against, the compliance books alone run to about 700,000 words -- roughly
// five context windows -- and the whole set to 2.4 million. So the reviewer
// gets paths and searches them.
//
// What it lists is *discovered*, not hardcoded. The first version wrote ten
// astraex-specific filenames into the binary while the config documented
// docs_root generically, so any other checkout would have been handed nine
// paths that do not exist -- and doctor would still have passed, because the
// root itself was there. Discovery also means the note stays true as the docs
// change, which they do far more often than the service is rebuilt.
//
// The citation requirement is the important part. the service submits under the
// operator's own GitHub identity, and a fabricated regulatory claim on a
// colleague's pull request -- "this violates Reg-T" when it does not -- costs
// far more than a wrong null-check comment. A finding that cannot name the
// document and section it rests on is not to be raised at all.

	// Windows passed. A path bound for a prompt has to be normalised the same
