// The gap it fills: the service off for a day comes back to a day of messages
// and reviews all of them. Usually that is exactly right -- it is why the
// watermark exists -- but sometimes the operator has already dealt with that
// window by hand, or simply does not want it, and the only way to say so was
// to let the sweep run and then live with the comments it posted.
//
// It reviews nothing and posts nothing. What it does is destructive in one
// specific way: the pull requests in the skipped window will not be reviewed
// unless somebody posts them again, so it prints what it is skipping.
