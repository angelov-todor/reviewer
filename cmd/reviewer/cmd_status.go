// A bare "reviewed" is what the operator was reading for a clean pull request
// that said nothing at all, so every verdict state gets its own string. In
// particular "reviewed / approved" (submitted) must not be confusable with
// "reviewed / no verdict" (a dry run, or a submission that failed -- Detail
// says which) or "reviewed / verdict unknown" (the reviewer never said).
//
// A review that was not the first pass over its pull request says so as well.
// Comments arriving twice on one pull request is the thing the operator will
// want explained, and this is the answer. Only a later pass is annotated:
// almost every row is a first pass, and saying "pass 1" on all of them would
// bury the one row that matters. A pre-existing row carries no pass number at
// all and reads as the first pass it was, never as "pass 0" -- see
