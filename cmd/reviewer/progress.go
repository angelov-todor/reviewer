// infrequent enough not to flood the log over a review that can run tens of

// progressRenderer renders pipeline.Event values as plain, single-line text
// -- no progress bars, no colour, no ANSI cursor movement, because this runs
// under Task Scheduler and in redirected logs at least as often as in a
// terminal. It writes to whatever io.Writer it is given; cmdScan and
// cmdReplay are what decide that this is always os.Stderr, never os.Stdout,
// since the decision table and status table are stdout output an operator may
// redirect to a file. (cmdWatch builds no renderer at all: it routes events
// through slogProgressHandler instead.)
//
// Reviews can run concurrently (review_concurrency), so several are in flight
// at once and their events interleave: a heartbeat for one review prints while
// Handle is reporting a stage of another. That makes this renderer shared
// mutable state on two counts, and both are guarded here rather than left to
// the caller.
//
//   - heartbeats: one per review, keyed by pull request, so starting and
//     stopping them cannot collide. The previous single field could not
//     represent two at once -- a second review_started overwrote the first
//     review's stop func, leaking its goroutine to print over the second's
//     output for the rest of the run.
//   - wmu: writes to w. The pipeline serialises its calls into Handle, but a
//     heartbeat goroutine is not one of those calls and writes on its own
//     schedule.
//
// The two locks are never held at the same time, and a heartbeat's stop func
// is always called holding neither: stopping waits for that goroutine to
// exit, and the goroutine needs a lock to finish a tick.
