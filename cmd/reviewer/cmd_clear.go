// The gap it fills: a review that did not finish is recorded needs_attention,
// which is terminal and correct -- a human has to look, because comments may
// be half posted. But once the human has looked, there was no way to say so.
// The record sat in `reviewer status` as an outstanding item forever, and the
// only way to move it was `reviewer replay`, which re-reviews a pull request
// that may well be merged and closed by then.
//
// Marked, not deleted. Deleting the row would take away the dedupe record too,
// so a link to the same pull request posted again in chat -- a colleague
// bumping an old thread -- would review it from scratch. A cleared record is
// terminal, so it stays a decision the service has already made; it simply stops
// asking for attention.
